Provider-specific SDKs:

OpenAI Node.js SDK
Anthropic Node.js SDK
Google AI Node.js SDK
Custom implementation for Ollama



4.3 Integration Requirements

HTTP/HTTPS for API communication

Implementation Recommendations

Start with a focused MVP:

Support for OpenAI and Claude initially
Basic MCP integration
Simple project management


Use a modular architecture:

Provider adapters that implement a common interface
Separation of UI and business logic
Clear boundaries between components


MCP Implementation:

Integrate the TypeScript MCP SDK
Create a configuration file parser for MCP servers
Build a permission system for tool execution


Storage Strategy:

Use SQLite for structured data (projects, messages)
Use the filesystem for larger attachments
Implement regular backups


Testing Strategy:

Unit tests for critical components
Integration tests for API interactions
E2E tests for main workflows
